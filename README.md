Analysis on the current drought that is affecting Chile. [Francisco Munoz, Felipe Kruuse, Cristian Ahumada. Group 17]

# Overview
It is well know that in the past decades a mega drought has been affecting some parts of Chile, affecting severely agriculture and cattle raising business among others. The goal of this project is to check, based on historical data, how relevant it is the current drought that is affecting our country. For that purpose, precipitation data captured from stations located throughout the country will be used to compute cumulated precipitation over the years. Questions we would like to answer are: what regions are the most affected by the drought? Has any similar drought occurred in the past? [TODO: more questions]

# Data
Our exploration is done using the [daily precipitation dataset](http://www.cr2.cl/datos-de-precipitacion/) generated by The Center for Climate and Resilience Research. This dataset contains 1249 stations from Chile and other countries from South America with daily precipitation records between years 1900-2018. Every daily record corresponds to the cumulated daily precipitation in millimeters, where a missing day is represented by "-9999". The format of the data is a matrix in a text file in the form of a transposed table (data sorted in rows instead of columns) where the first 14 rows contain information such as station code, coordinates or source, and the following rows contain the observed measurements corresponding to each period in time, for all the stations considered. This dataset contains 53.794.430 records of daily precipitation, where some of them could be missing (and thus registered as -9999). This number is compacted in the form of a matrix with 1249 rows and approximately 43.080 columns. We choose this dataset because it collects data from different sources such as DGA (Dirección general del Agua), DMC (Dirección meteorológica de chile) and GHCN (Global Historical Climatology Network) resulting in a very complete dataset.
