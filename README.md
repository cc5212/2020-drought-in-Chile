# 2020-drought-in-Chile
Analysis on the current drought that is affecting Chile. [Francisco Munoz, Felipe Kruuse, Cristian Ahumada. Group 17]

# Overview
It is well know that in the past decades a mega drought is affecting some parts of Chile, affecting severely agriculture and cattle raising. The goal of this project is to check, based on historical data, how relevant is the current drought that is affecting our country. For that purpose, precipitation data captured from stations located throughout the country will be used to compute cumulated precipitation over the years. Questions we would like to answer are: what regions are the most affected by the drought? Has any similar drought ocurred in the past? [TODO: more questions]

# Data
Our exploration is done using the [daily precipitation dataset](http://www.cr2.cl/datos-de-precipitacion/) generated by The Center for Climate and Resilience Research. This dataset contains 1249 stations from chile and others countries from south america with daily precipitation records between the years 1900 and 2018. Every daily records correspond to the cumulated daily precipitation in milimeters, where a missing day is represented by -9999. The format of the data is a matrix in a text file in the form of a transposed table (data sorted in rows instead of columns) where the the first 14 rows contain information such as station code, coordinates or source, and the following rows contain the observed measurements corresponding to each period in time, for all the stations considered. This dataset contains 53.794.430 records of daily precipitation, where some of them could be missing (and thus registered as -9999), this number is compacted in the form of a matrix with 1249 rows and aproximately 43.080 columns. We choose this dataset because it collect data from different sources such as DGA (Direccion general del Agua), DMC (Direccion meteorologica de chile) and GHCN (Global Historical Climatology Network) resulting in a very complete dataset.
