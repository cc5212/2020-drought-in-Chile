# 2020-drought-in-Chile
Analysis on the current drought that is affecting Chile. [Francisco Munoz, Felipe Kruuse, Cristian Ahumada. Group 17]

# Overview
The goal of this project is to check, based on historical data, how relevant is the current drought that is affecting our country (Chile). It is well know that in the past decades a mega drought is affecting some parts of Chile, affecting severely agriculture and cattle raising. Using precipitation data captured from stations located throughout the country it's possible to quantify the magnitude of a drought based on decreasig precipitation. Questions we would like to answer are: what regions are the most affected by the drought? Has any similar drought ocurred in the past? [TODO: more questions]
